            Using this app, you can search the name of any city and receive the
            current temperature in celcius and fahrenheit. It will also show you
            the temperature of the next 5 days, at the exact same time of the
            day. This is not ideal! The app will also show the country in which
            that city is located. You can change the country by typing the
            two-letter code of that country following a comma and a space after
            the city name.

            This one is very similar to the previous one, but I had not worked
            on the colours as much. To be fair, I am not very good at designing
            and colours anyway! So I cannot claim that the other one is an
            improvement to this one!

            As a parent of deaf children, you can connect with other parents and
            Deaf nannies. We believe that connecting with others who share your
            social identity helps you feel belonged, less alone and more
            confident. You can also ask your questions and get practical help
            easier. Most importantly, however, your child will be in a rich
            language environment which is essential to their healthy development
